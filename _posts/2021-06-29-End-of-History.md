During the 90s Francis Fukuyama wrote an infamous book: 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man]('The End of 
History and the Last Man'), which is mostly remembered now as the punchline to
bitter jokes. This is a little unfair to Fukuyama whose argument was a little
more subtle than the title suggested.

Fukuyama argued that with the passing of the Soviet Union the world was left
with one viable political system - western liberal democracy. The years have not
been kind to this thesis. Various eastern european countries are abandoning
their brief dalliance with democracy and are instead embracing authoritarian and
fascist forms of government. The Republican party in the US is embracing fascism
and sees its future as one that is incompatible with mass democracy. The UK, the
birthplace of liberal icon John Locke, is becoming a one party state. Even in
countries that are doing well, the elite political direction is towards
increased centralization and authoritarianism.

These trends are driven by two things:
1. The collapse of the post-war economic consensus.
2. The emancipation of business elites.

After world war II it was undeniable that things got better for the inhabitants
of 'western' countries. In transformede countries you saw inhabiants lives transformed
from extreme rural poverty to a life that had some material comforts (e.g. Japan
and Italy). Some countries saw extraordinary levels of economic development
(western Europe, Japan), while countries that were already relatively wealthy
(UK, US) spread that wealth to a much broader base of the population. While
there was plenty of political friction during this time, social democratic
parties were able to argue convincingly that they had delivered extraordinary
gains.

Then in the 70s, after a period where the US flooded the world with dollars to
pay for Vietnam, the system began to breakdown culminating in the oil crisis and
stagflation. The reactionary right, who had been patiently preparing since the 
end of WWII, were able to move into an ideological vacuum and fill it with
classical liberalism (neoliberalism in anglo dominated countries, ordoliberalism in
germanic countries).

In order to succeed this ideology had to deliver economically, but as an
economic model it was hopeless. Economic growth fell signicantly below post WWII
norms, never to recover. But these ideologies were able to disguise their
failure to deliver in three ways:
1. By redistributing wealth from the bottom to the top (or more accurately, by
   ending redistribution from the wealthy to the poor).
2. By privatizing the commons, and spreading the wealth to a large enough base
   as would support their policies.

These policies, along with the encouragement of speculation in the UK/US,
created an illusion of increased wealth. If you were a professional, or secure
middle class person, you saw your personal wealth increase. And while you may
have been worried by the gradual impoverishment of schools and hospitals, you
probably didn't connect these facts to your booming stock portfolio.

On top of that, the nu-liberals were able to benefit from various windfalls.
Energy prices fell, while the increasing openness of third world economies to
first world exploitation caused a collapse in the price of consumer goods. This accelerated
spectacularly when China began to aggressively industrialize.

But despite this, during all this period there were signs of strain. Voter
participation fell, economic crises became more frequent and the size of the
population who were excluded from the redistributive largesse slowly increased
with each new generation. And most significantly western countries became
gradually post-industrial, resulting in a lumpenproletariat who experienced
a rapid social decline.

Finally in 2008 the system collapsed. While various elites were able to rebuild
much of the infrastructure, the consensus that had built around markets and
nu-liberalism was shattered, but there was nothing to replace it. There were of
course various contenders, but all of these were nostalgic and not terribly
convincing projects of political nostalgia. Every significant political grouping
agreed that we had strayed from a prior golden age, even if noone could agree on
when or what that golden age was.

And so we're left with a zombie politics. Neoliberalism as an ideology is dead,
but neoliberalism as an administrative apparatus is very much with us. Political
elections are between center-right parties who want to conserve a late 90s
consensus, and parties of the right who wish to restore pre WWII, or even WWI,
social and economic structures. The social and economic concerns of the majority
of western populations are ignored and denied, while our politics completely
fails to address issues that may threaten our existence as a species. But 
despite this, it is impossible to imagine anything new replacing our sclerotic 
political structures.

So Fukuyama has turned out to be correct. Liberal democracy is the end point of
political development, not because it is a good system but because it is the
least bad system we can imagine. It doesn't work - but fails better than the
alternatives. We should mourn the end of history rather than celebrate it.
